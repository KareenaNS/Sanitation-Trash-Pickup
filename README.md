# Trash Pickup QR Code System

This project allows trash collectors to scan QR codes on trash cans to check if residents have paid for the month and whether their trash has been picked up for the week.

## Features
- Generate unique QR codes for each resident's trash can.
- Scan QR code to display red (unpaid) or green (paid).
- Update trash pickup status weekly.

## Sprint 1 Features
- Known bugs: residents are unable to be added to the database, UI for this page needs to be fixed as well, residents payment and trash collected field are not editable currently
- Next features to implement: a login for the user in sanitation to update residents, debugging
- Future sprints: generate a QR code based on the resident's ID, linking the QR code to the resident ID, automating having the user scan a QR code and it automatically marks the trash as picked up for that resident (changeable based on the week), automating payments

## Sprint 2 Features
