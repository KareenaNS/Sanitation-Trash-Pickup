# Trash Pickup QR Code System

This project allows trash collectors to scan QR codes on trash cans to check if residents have paid for the month and whether their trash has been picked up for the week.

## Features
- Generate unique QR codes for each resident's trash can.
- Scan QR code to display red (unpaid) or green (paid).
- Update trash pickup status weekly.
